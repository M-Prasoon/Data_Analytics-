# Sales-Analysis-Python-EDA
Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project! This repository contains the code and data for analyzing sales data . The project aims to uncover insights and trends that can help drive strategic decisions in sales and marketing.


## Key Features

- **Data Merging**: Combine sales data from multiple CSV files into a single dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates for data quality.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify the best months for sales and the most profitable products.
- **Geographical Insights**: Determine which cities have the highest sales.
- **Optimal Advertising Times**: Discover the best times to display advertisements.
- **Product Bundling**: Identify products that are often sold together.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data processing and analysis.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
  - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.


## Project Structure

- `Sales Data/`: Contains the raw sales data CSV files.
- `Analysis/`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for data processing and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.


## Visualizations

The project generates several key visualizations to help understand the data:

- **Sales by Year Month**: A bar plot showing sales trends over time.
- **Sales and Quantity Ordered by City**: A combination plot showing sales and quantity ordered by city.
- **Frequency of Orders by Hour**: A line plot showing the frequency of orders by hour.
- **Quantity Ordered by Product**: A bar plot showing the quantity ordered for each product.
- **Quantity Ordered vs. Price Each**: A combination plot showing the quantity ordered and average price for each product.


## Example Insights

- **Best Month for Sales**: December 2019 had the highest sales, with a total of $4.59M, likely due to holiday shopping.

- **Top Cities for Sales**: San Francisco, CA, leads in sales revenue, followed by Los Angeles, CA, and New York City, NY.

- **Optimal Advertising Times**: The highest sales were recorded at 19:00 and 12:00, indicating peak times for customer engagement.

- **Popular Product Bundles**: Customers frequently purchased smartphones with charging cables, reflecting a common need for accessories.

- **Top Selling Products**: Lower-priced items like batteries were sold in high qu# Sales-Analysis-Python-EDA
